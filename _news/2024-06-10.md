**New survey paper on inverse problem meets stochastic optimization methods.** 

<br> 

Recently with my colleagues, we wrote a survey on stochastic optimization methods and large-scale inverse problems. In the survey, we present a comprehensive discussions on various types of stochastic optimization methods, and how they are utilized in solving large-scale inverse problems. Check this [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06342) for more details.

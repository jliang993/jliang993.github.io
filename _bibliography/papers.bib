  abstract={Stochastic optimisation algorithms are the de facto standard for machine learning with large amounts of data. Handling only a subset of available data in each optimisation step dramatically reduces the per-iteration computational costs, while still ensuring significant progress towards the solution. Driven by the need to solve large-scale optimisation problems as efficiently as possible, the last decade has witnessed an explosion of research in this area. Leveraging the parallels between machine learning and inverse problems has allowed harnessing the power of this research wave for solving inverse problems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive account of the state-of-the-art in stochastic optimisation from the viewpoint of inverse problems. We present algorithms with diverse modalities of problem randomisation and discuss the roles of variance reduction, acceleration, higher-order methods, and other algorithmic modifications, and compare theoretical results with practical behaviour. We focus on the potential and the challenges for stochastic optimisation that are unique to inverse imaging problems and are not commonly encountered in machine learning. We conclude the survey with illustrative examples from imaging problems to examine the advantages and disadvantages that this new generation of algorithms bring to the field of inverse problems.},

  abstract={Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows several clients to learn a global model without sharing their private data. In this paper, we generalize a primal dual fixed point (PDFP) \cite{PDFP} method to federated learning setting and propose an algorithm called Federated PDFP (FPDFP) for solving composite optimization problems. In addition, a quantization scheme is applied to reduce the communication overhead during the learning process. An $O(1/k)$ convergence rate (where is the communication round) of the proposed FPDFP is provided. Numerical experiments, including graph-guided logistic regression, 3D Computed Tomography (CT) reconstruction are considered to evaluate the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract={The classical synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging techniques based on matched filters are limited by data bandwidth, resulting in limited imaging performance with side lobes and speckles present. To address the high-resolution SAR imaging problem, sparse reconstruction has been extensively investigated. However, the state-of-the-art sparse recovery methods seldom consider the complex-valued reflectivity of the scene and only recover an approximated real-valued scene instead. Furthermore, iterative schemes associated with the sparse recovery methods demand a high computational cost, which limits the practical applications of these methods. In this paper, we establish a sphere-constrained magnitude-sparsity SAR imaging model, aiming at enhancing the SAR imaging quality with high efficiency. We propose a non-convex non-smooth optimization method, which can be accelerated by stochastic average gradient acceleration to be scalable with large-scale problems. Numerical experiments are conducted with point-target and extended-target simulations. On the one hand, the point-target simulation showcases the superiority of our proposed method over the classical methods in terms of resolution. On the other hand, the extended-target simulation with random phases is considered to be in line with the practical scenario, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms the classical SAR imaging methods and sparse recovery without phase prior in terms of PSNR. Meanwhile, owing to the stochastic acceleration, our method is faster than the existing sparse recovery methods by orders of magnitude.},

The position constraint is enforced by considering a narrow-band distance function and complimentary dice function in the loss function. Through a series of comparisons and ablation study, we evaluate the performance of our proposed cascaded network architecture and the additional loss functions using an in-house dataset for gallbladder polyps segmentation and classification. Numerical results indicate that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement over conventional U-Net, U-Net++, etc.. Lastly, the pathological type classification based on the segmented polys shows 30\% higher accuracy compared to those conventional ResNet based results.},

While existing research usually pursues a globally smoothed graph embedding, we believe the rarely observed anomalies are as well harmful to an accurate prediction. This work establishes a graph learning scheme that automatically detects (locally) corrupted feature attributes and recovers robust embedding for prediction tasks. The detection operation leverages a graph autoencoder, which does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the local corruptions. It pinpoints the positions of the anomalous node attributes in an unbiased mask matrix, where robust estimations are recovered with sparsity promoting regularizer. The optimizer approaches a new embedding that is sparse in the framelet domain and conditionally close to input observations. Extensive experiments are provided to validate our proposed model can recover a robust graph representation from black-box poisoning and achieve excellent performance.},

  abstract={Sparsity-promoting regularizers are widely used to impose low-complexity structure (e.g., l1-norm for sparsity) to the regression coefficients of supervised learning. In the realm of deterministic optimization, the sequence generated by iterative algorithms (such as proximal gradient descent) exhibit “finite activity identification” property, that is, they can identify the low-complexity structure of the solution in a finite number of iterations. However, many online algorithms (such as proximal stochastic gradient descent) do not have this property owing to the vanishing step-size and nonvanishing variance. In this article, by combining with a screening rule, we show how to eliminate useless features of the iterates generated by online algorithms, and thereby enforce finite sparsity identification. One advantage of our scheme is that when combined with any convergent online algorithm, sparsity properties imposed by the regularizer can be exploited to improve computational efficiency. Numerically, significant acceleration can be obtained.},

Over the past few years, great empirical success has been obtained by PnP algorithms, especially for the ones that integrate deep learning-based denoisers. However, a key problem of PnP approaches is the need for manual parameter tweaking which is essential to obtain high-quality results across the high discrepancy in imaging conditions and varying scene content. In this work, we present a class of tuning-free PnP proximal algorithms that can determine parameters such as denoising strength, termination time, and other optimization-specific parameters automatically. A core part of our approach is a policy network for automated parameter search which can be effectively learned via a mixture of model-free and model-based deep reinforcement learning strategies. We demonstrate, through rigorous numerical and visual experiments, that the learned policy can customize parameters to different settings, and is often more efficient and effective than existing handcrafted criteria. Moreover, we discuss several practical considerations of PnP denoisers, which together with our learned policy yield state-of-the-art results. This advanced performance is prevalent on both linear and nonlinear exemplar inverse imaging problems, and in particular shows promising results on compressed sensing MRI, sparse-view CT, single-photon imaging, and phase retrieval. },

  abstract={The “fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm,” a.k.a. FISTA, is one of the most well known first-order optimization scheme in the literature, as it achieves the worst-case $O(1/k^2)$ optimal convergence rate for objective function value. However, despite such an optimal theoretical convergence rate, in practice the (local) oscillatory behavior of FISTA often damps its efficiency. Over the past years, various efforts have been made in the literature to improve the practical performance of FISTA, such as monotone FISTA, restarting FISTA, and backtracking strategies. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective modification to the original FISTA scheme which has two advantages: It allows us to (1) prove the convergence of generated sequence and (2) design a so-called lazy-start strategy which can be up to an order faster than the original scheme. Moreover, we propose novel adaptive and greedy strategies which further improve the practical performance. The advantages of the proposed schemes are tested through problems arising from inverse problems, machine learning, and signal/image processing.},

  abstract={This paper is devoted to proposing a general weighted low-rank recovery model and designing a fast SVD-free computational scheme to solve it. First, our generic weighted low-rank recovery model unifies several existing approaches in the literature.~Moreover, our model readily extends to the non-convex setting. Algorithm-wise, most first-order proximal algorithms in the literature for low-rank recoveries require computing singular value decomposition (SVD). As SVD does not scale appropriately with the dimension of the matrices, these algorithms become slower when the problem size becomes larger. By incorporating the variational formulation of the nuclear norm into the sub-problem of proximal gradient descent, we avoid computing SVD, which results in significant speed-up. Moreover, our algorithm preserves the rank identification property of nuclear norm [33] which further allows us to design a rank continuation scheme that asymptotically achieves the minimal iteration complexity. Numerical experiments on both toy examples and real-world problems, including structure from motion (SfM) and photometric stereo, background estimation, and matrix completion, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm.},

With the tool of "partial smoothness", we design a framework to analyze the trajectory of the fixed-point sequence generated by first-order methods and show that locally, the fixed-point sequence settles onto a regular trajectory such as a straight line or a spiral. Based on this finding, we discuss the limitation of current widely used "inertial acceleration" technique, and propose a trajectory following adaptive acceleration algorithm. Global convergence is established for the proposed acceleration scheme based on the perturbation of fixed-point iteration. Locally, we first build connections between the acceleration scheme and the well-studied "vector extrapolation technique" in the field of numerical analysis, and then discuss local acceleration guarantees of the proposed acceleration scheme. Moreover, our result provides a geometric interpretation of these vector extrapolation techniques. Numerical experiments on various first-order methods are provided to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed adaptive acceleration scheme.},

For the global rate, we establish a sublinear convergence rate in terms of a Bregman divergence suitably designed for the objective function. Moreover, when specializing to the Forward-Backward splitting, we prove a stronger convergence rate result for the objective function value. Then locally, based on the assumption that the non-smooth part of the optimization problem is partly smooth, we establish local linear convergence of the method. More precisely, we show that the sequence generated by Forward-Douglas-Rachford first (i) identifies a smooth manifold in a finite number of iteration and then (ii) enters a local linear convergence regime, which is for instance characterized in terms of the structure of the underlying active smooth manifold. To exemplify the usefulness of the obtained result, we consider several concrete numerical experiments arising from applicative fields including, for instance, signal/image processing, inverse problems and machine learning.},

More precisely, in our framework, we first show that (i) the sequences generated by Primal-Dual splitting methods identify a pair of primal and dual smooth manifolds in a finite number of iterations, and then (ii) enter a local linear convergence regime, which is characterized based on the structure of the underlying active smooth manifolds. We also show how our results for Primal-Dual splitting can be specialized to cover existing ones on Forward-Backward splitting and Douglas-Rachford splitting/ADMM (alternating direction methods of multipliers). Moreover, based on these obtained local convergence analysis result, several practical acceleration techniques are discussed. To exemplify the usefulness of the obtained result, we consider several concrete numerical experiments arising from fields including signal/image processing, inverse problems and machine learning. The demonstration not only verifies the local linear convergence behaviour of Primal-Dual splitting methods, but also the insights on how to accelerate them in practice.},

  abstract={In this paper, we consider a class of Forward--Backward (FB) splitting methods that includes several variants (e.g., inertial schemes, FISTA) for minimizing the sum of two proper convex and lower semicontinuous functions, one of which has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, and the other is partly smooth relative to a smooth active manifold $M$. We propose a unified framework, under which we show that this class of FB-type algorithms (i) correctly identifies the active manifold in a finite number of iterations (finite activity identification), and (ii) then enters a local linear convergence regime, which we characterize precisely in terms of the structure of the underlying active manifold. We also establish and explain why FISTA (with convergent sequences) locally oscillates and can be locally slower than FB. These results may have numerous applications including in signal/image processing, sparse recovery and machine learning. Indeed, the obtained results explain the typical behaviour that has been observed numerically for many problems in these fields such as the Lasso, the group Lasso, the fused Lasso and the nuclear norm minimization to name only a few.},

  abstract={ This manuscript is concerned with convergence analysis of first-order operator splitting methods that are ubiquitous in modern non-smooth optimization. It consists of three main theoretical advances on this class of methods, namely global convergence rates, novel operator splitting schemes and local linear convergence. First, we propose global (sub-linear) and local (linear) convergence rates for the inexact Krasnosel’skii-Mann iteration built from non-expansive operators, and its application to a variety of monotone operator splitting schemes. Then we design two novel multi-step inertial operator splitting algorithms, both in the convex and non-convex settings, and prove their global convergence. Finally, building on the key concept of partial smoothness, we present a unified and sharp local linear convergence analysis for the class of first-order proximal splitting methods for optimization. We show that for all these algorithms, under appropriate non-degeneracy conditions, the iterates generated by each of these methods will (i) identify the involved partial smooth manifolds in finite time, and then (ii) enter a local linear convergence regime. The linear convergence rates are characterized precisely based on the structure of the optimization problems, that of the proximal splitting scheme, and the geometry of the identified active manifolds. Our theoretical findings are systematically illustrated on applications arising from inverse problems, signal/image processing and machine learning. },

  abstract={In this paper, we present a convergence rate analysis for the inexact Krasnosel'skiĭ-Mann iteration built from non-expansive operators. The presented results include two main parts: we first establish the global pointwise and ergodic iteration-complexity bounds; then, under a metric sub-regularity assumption, we establish a local linear convergence for the distance of the iterates to the set of fixed points. The obtained results can be applied to analyze the convergence rate of various monotone operator splitting methods in the literature, including the Forward-Backward splitting, the Generalized Forward-Backward, the Douglas-Rachford splitting, alternating direction method of multipliers and Primal-Dual splitting methods. For these methods, we also develop easily verifiable termination criteria for finding an approximate solution, which can be seen as a generalization of the termination criterion for the classical gradient descent method. We finally develop a parallel analysis for the non-stationary Krasnosel'skiĭ-Mann iteration.},

  abstract={Convex optimization has become ubiquitous in most quantitative disciplines of science, including variational image processing. Proximal splitting algorithms are becoming popular to solve such structured convex optimization problems. Within this class of algorithms, Douglas-Rachford (DR) and ADMM are designed to minimize the sum of two proper lower semi-continuous convex functions whose proximity operators are easy to compute. The goal of this work is to understand the local convergence behaviour of DR (resp. ADMM) when the involved functions (resp. their Legendre-Fenchel conjugates) are moreover partly smooth. More precisely, when both of the two functions (resp. their conjugates) are partly smooth relative to their respective manifolds, we show that DR (resp.

Based on the observation that illumination varies smoother than reflectance, we propose a convex variational model which can effectively decompose the gradient field of images into salient edges and relatively smoother illumination field through the first- and second-order total variation regularizations. The proposed model can be efficiently solved by a primal-dual splitting method. Numerical experiments on both grayscale and color images show the strength of the proposed model with applications to Retinex illusions, medical image bias field removal, and color image shadow correction.},

  abstract={ Restoration/interpolation of missing traces plays a crucial role in the seismic data processing pipeline. Efficient restoration methods have been proposed based on sparse signal representation in a transform domain such as Fourier, wavelet, curvelet, and shearlet transforms. Most existing methods are based on transforms with a fixed basis. We considered an adaptive sparse transform for restoration of data with complex structures. In particular, we evaluated a data-driven tight-frame-based sparse regularization method for seismic data restoration. The main idea of the data-driven tight frame (TF) is to adaptively learn a set of framelet filters from the currently interpolated data, under which the data can be more sparsely represented; hence, the sparsity-promoting l1-norm (SPL1) minimization methods can produce better restoration results by using the learned filters. A split inexact Uzawa algorithm, which can be viewed as a generalization of the alternating direction of multiplier method (ADMM), was applied to solve the presented SPL1 model. Numerical tests were performed on synthetic and real seismic data for restoration of randomly missing traces over a regular data grid. Our experiments showed that our proposed method obtains the state-of-the-art restoration results in comparison with the traditional Fourier-based projection onto convex sets, the tight-frame-based method, and the recent shearlet regularization ADMM method.},

Most of the existing color demosaicing methods [14, 25, 16, 2, 26] are based on interpolation from inter-channel correlation and local geometry, which are not robust to highly saturated color images with small geometric features. In this paper, we introduce wavelet frame based methods by using a sparse wavelet [8, 22, 9, 23] approximation of individual color channels and color differences that recovers both geometric features and color information. The proposed models can be efficiently solved by Bregmanized operator splitting algorithm [27]. Numerical simulations of two datasets: McM and Kodak PhotoCD, show that our method outperforms other existing methods in terms of PSNR and visual quality.},
